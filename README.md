# Advanced Visual Geometry Labs

## Overview
This repository contains a series of advanced visual geometry lab exercises developed as part of my coursework. The projects explore key concepts in computer vision and computational geometry, such as camera modeling, 3D reconstruction, feature extraction, epipolar geometry, and homographies.

The goal is to implement, visualize, and understand fundamental algorithms that underpin modern computer vision systems.
